      <description>Create-React-App (CRA) has provided a very comfortable environment for most people to get started with running a React application. It handles a bunch of configurations for you out of the box (think Webpack, test setup, babel, etc.) There are many dev&amp;rsquo;s in my organization who reference this as the starting place.
My team works heavily with all of the Patient pages (Home, Profile, Search, etc.) so a large portion of my work deals with rendering React on the server for SEO purposes, so wanting to figure out how CRA could play a role in this caught my interest.</description>
