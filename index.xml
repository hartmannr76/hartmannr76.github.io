      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve generally enjoyed reading other dev&amp;rsquo;s blogs. I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to include my own content over the years but never ended up getting too far with each iteration, mostly due to configuring the blogging platform. Having tried WordPress and Ghost, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that just simple markdown with Hugo is going to make things a bit easier, so here goes nothing!</description>

      <description>So I was reading this post a while ago on wiring up a server-side-rendering pipeline into the Create React Application and decided to try this myself, but in a language/framework that I like for server side programming (no offense JavaScript).
I ended up getting something that worked pretty well and will probably explain it more in detail at some point in time.
